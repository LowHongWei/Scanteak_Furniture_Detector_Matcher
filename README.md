# Furniture Object Detector & Recommender using Detectron2 & VGG16

This repository contains all the code to complete iDECOR, a Furniture Recommender that help users who have recently moved to explore IKEA products at ease.

After uploading a room scene image, IDECOR returns users with similar-styled furnitures in favour from IKEA product catalog.

### Business Values of this Project
Amazon is a giant in ecommerce which has its [35% revenue generated by its recommendation engine](https://rejoiner.com/resources/amazon-recommendations-secret-selling-online/). This proportion has potential to increase up to 60% based off its competitors.

This project is to drive conversions-to-sales of IKEA's and other furniture ecommerce stores, by providing **better onsite recommendations**.

### Project Overview
- Developed a customized solution for furniture shoppers, by wrapping furniture detection and recommendation system into a seamless process on [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/). 

- Leveraged 2 Deep Learning technologies: 
	- [Detectron2](https://ai.facebook.com/tools/detectron2/) (developed by Facebook AI): Detect every furniture item in user's uploaded image
	- VGG16 model: Detect furniture features and generate vector representations for respective furniture items

- Returned users with 5 most-similar furniture items, from product catalogue web-scraped from [IKEA Hong Kong](https://www.ikea.com.hk/en) using Selenium

- Made iDECOR available across 6 furniture products, and will expand to more brands/ categories with API support in the future.

#### Project Overview 
<p>iDECOR is a customized solution for furniture shoppers by wrapping furniture detection and recommendation system into a single, seamless process on Streamlit. This product leverages two deep learning technologies - 1) Detectron2 developed by Facebook to detect every possible furniture item in the user's uploaded image, and 2) VGG16 model to help narrow down most similar items to the detected item in terms of visual cues, and return them with top 5 items from our furniture product catalogue, in order to drive conversions to sales of furniture retailers by improving onsite recommendations. iDECOR is made available across six furniture products as the first step, and will expand to more brands/categories with API support in the future.</p>

#### Business Objectives
<li>To drive IKEA's (or other furntiure e-commerce stores) sales by providing better onsite recommendations. </li>

#### Prerequisites
1. CPU
2. GPU x 1

#### Installation
1. Detectron2 Library
- Built on PyTorch
- NVIDIA GPU requirement

2. Similarity Detection


#### Data Collection
1. Bonn Furniture Style Dataset:  Contains 90000+ furniture images with style labelled by interior design professionals. In the dataset, there are 6 different furniture types. The furniture in the dataset is categorized into beds, chairs, dressers, lamps, sofas and tables. [1]

2. Open Images Dataset V6: A dataset of ~9M images annotated with image-level labels, object bounding boxes, object segmentation masks, visual relationships, and localized narratives. [2]

3. IKEA Product Catalogue Dataset: Web-scraped 1000+ products directly from IKEA site for recommendations to user later. [3]


#### Data Preprocessing:
- Balanced Dataset
- Detectron2 Formatting with Annotations
- Mutli-label Binarizers
- Annotations 
- Image resize before training
- Drop duplicates
- Augmentation



#### Architecture

<p>This flowchart shows five main stages during the whole development of our product, with different focus, tools and technologies we have used within which we will explain further. </p>

1. Data Acquisition
- Collected 3 types of datasets for training of both Detectron2 and VGG16 models, and for recommendations as feedback, as mentioned in the above section.

2. Data Preprocessing
- Took advantage of the high computational power of Google Colab and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to help filter to desired categories, annotate bouding box coordinates, resize images, encode multiple labels per instance, and augmentate the images, for model training.

3. Model Engineering
- Prepare the codes as the skeleton to train and make inference on the models.
- Built the configurations crucial for the training of Detectron2 model using built-in DefaultTrainer with passing annotation dicts and labelled images, and trained it using Pytorch.
- Compared similarity model between VGG16 and InceptionV3 using transfer learning and established our final model with VGG16 upon Keras and Tensorflow.

4. Evaluation
